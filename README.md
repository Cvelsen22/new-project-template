## Cookiecutter Data Science
This project template is a simplified version of the [Cookiecutter Data Science](https://cookiecutter-data-science.drivendata.org) template, created to suit the needs of Datalumina and made available as a GitHub template.

## Adjusting .gitignore

Ensure you adjust the `.gitignore` file according to your project needs. For example, since this is a template, the `/data/` folder is commented out and data will not be exlucded from source control:

```plaintext
# exclude data from source control by default
# /data/
```

Typically, you want to exclude this folder if it contains either sensitive data that you do not want to add to version control or large files.

## Duplicating the .env File
To set up your environment variables, you need to duplicate the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`. You can do this manually or using the following terminal command:

```bash
cp .env.example .env # Linux, macOS, Git Bash, WSL
copy .env.example .env # Windows Command Prompt
```

This command creates a copy of `.env.example` and names it `.env`, allowing you to configure your environment variables specific to your setup.
